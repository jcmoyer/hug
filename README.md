# hug [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcmoyer/hug.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jcmoyer/hug)

Minimalistic utility library for LÖVE. Documentation can be [read online](http://jcmoyer.github.io/hug/doc/) or compiled manually using [LDoc](https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc).

# Getting started
The fastest way to get started with hug is by cloning it into your LÖVE game directory. Here, hug is cloned into `hug/` (relative to the directory where `main.lua` and `conf.lua` are kept):

    $ git clone https://github.com/jcmoyer/hug.git

Now you can load hug modules using `require`:

    local color = require('hug.color')
    local red = color.new(255, 0, 0)

    function love.draw()
      love.graphics.setColor(red)
      love.graphics.rectangle('fill', 0, 0, 128, 128)
    end
